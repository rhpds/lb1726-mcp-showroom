= MCP Registry

In the previous module, you deployed and configured individual MCP servers — adding tool filters, enabling telemetry, and extending AI capabilities with new servers. As organizations scale their AI initiatives, a new challenge emerges: how do you manage dozens or hundreds of MCP servers across teams, environments, and use cases?

This module introduces the *MCP Registry* — a centralized catalog for discovering, governing, and managing MCP servers at enterprise scale. You will learn how to deploy your own registry, populate it with approved servers, and explore the governance patterns that make AI tool management tractable.

== What is an MCP Registry?

An MCP Registry is a centralized catalog that indexes all available MCP servers in your organization. Think of it as an "app store" for AI capabilities — a searchable, documented, governed collection of tools that AI agents can discover and use.

The registry provides:

*Centralized Catalog*:: A single source of truth listing every MCP server available in your organization, with descriptions, capabilities, and connection information.

*Standardized API*:: A REST API that follows the https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/blob/main/docs/reference/api/generic-registry-api.md[MCP Registry specification^], enabling programmatic discovery by tools, automation, and AI clients. This means that while this lab is using ToolHive the skills you learn are transferable to any other MCP registry that follows this specification.

*Rich Metadata*:: Each server entry includes detailed information — what tools it provides, what environment variables it needs, what transport it uses, and its governance status.

*Dynamic Discovery*:: The registry can aggregate both manually-curated server entries and automatically-discovered running instances, keeping the catalog current.

=== Business Value of MCP Registries

The value of a registry becomes clear as MCP adoption grows. Without centralized management, organizations face fragmented tool access, duplicated efforts, and governance blind spots.

==== For Decision Makers

*Centralized Governance*:: A single point of control for approving or deprecating AI tool access. Security and compliance teams can review and approve servers before they appear in the catalog.

*Complete Audit Trail*:: Know exactly what AI capabilities are deployed across your organization. When auditors ask "what can your AI systems access?", you have a definitive answer.

*Risk Classification*:: Classify servers by tier (Official, Community, Experimental) and status (Active, Deprecated). Control which categories are permitted in production environments.

*Compliance Enablement*:: Demonstrate to auditors that AI tool access is controlled, documented, and follows your organization's change management processes.

==== For Platform Engineers

*Reduced Configuration Drift*:: The registry is the single source of truth for server endpoints and configuration. No more hunting through wikis or Slack channels for connection details.

*Simplified Lifecycle Management*:: Update server metadata in one place. When a server version changes or an endpoint moves, update the registry — clients discover the change automatically.

*Multi-Cluster Visibility*:: While each cluster can have its own registry, the standardized API enables aggregation and federated views across environments.

*Observability Foundation*:: Registry metadata can enrich monitoring dashboards — track which servers are available, their versions, and usage patterns.

==== For Developers

*Self-Service Discovery*:: Browse available AI tools without asking colleagues. The registry documents what's available, what each server does, and how to connect.

*Consistent Configuration*:: Get the right connection details, required environment variables, and configuration parameters from a single authoritative source.

*Faster Integration*:: The standard API means tools can auto-configure. Future AI clients will query the registry and present available servers automatically.

*Reduced Duplication*:: Before building a new MCP server, check the registry. Someone may have already created what you need.

== Setting up Your MCP Registry

Now let's deploy a working MCP Registry in your OpenShift environment.

=== Database Backend

The MCP Registry needs persistent storage to maintain the server catalog, support efficient queries, and enable future features like usage analytics. We use PostgreSQL, deployed via the CloudNativePG operator — a production-grade solution that handles clustering, automated backups, and failover.

The database initialization includes an important security design: separate users for different purposes. The `db_migrator` user has schema modification privileges (for database upgrades), while `db_app` is the runtime user with minimal privileges. This separation follows the principle of least privilege — even if the runtime application is compromised, attackers cannot modify the database schema.

. Switch back to the Gitea tab. Again we are taking the same shortcut to create all new resources in the Gitea MCP Server Helm chart.
+
Create a PostgreSQL database by adding file `psql.yaml` under the `templates` path of the Gitea MCP Server Helm chart:
+
[source,yaml,role=execute,subs=attributes]

  bootstrap:

      postInitApplicationSQL:

          BEGIN;

          DO $body$
            DECLARE
              migrator_user TEXT := 'db_migrator';
              migrator_password TEXT := 'migrator_password';

              app_user TEXT := 'db_app';
              app_password TEXT := 'app_password';

              db_name TEXT := 'registry';
            BEGIN
              EXECUTE format('CREATE USER %I WITH PASSWORD %L', migrator_user, migrator_password);
              EXECUTE format('GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE %I TO %I', db_name, migrator_user);

              EXECUTE format('GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO %I', migrator_user);

              CREATE ROLE toolhive_registry_server;

              EXECUTE format('CREATE USER %I WITH PASSWORD %L', app_user, app_password);
              EXECUTE format('GRANT toolhive_registry_server TO %I', app_user);
              EXECUTE format('GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE %I TO %I', db_name, app_user);
            END;
          $body$;

          COMMIT;
----

=== Preparing the Server Catalog

The registry needs a `ConfigMap` to store its server catalog. We'll start with an empty catalog and let ToolHive's automatic discovery populate it with running servers.

[start=2]
. Create an empty `ConfigMap` to hold the MCP Registry configuration. Add file `configmap-mcp-registry-config.yaml` to the `templates`:
+
[source,yaml,role=execute,subs=attributes]
----
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: mcp-registry-config
  namespace: {{ .Values.namespace}}
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave: "1"
data:
  registry.json: |
    {
      "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stacklok/toolhive/main/pkg/registry/data/schema.json",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "last_updated": "2025-01-14T00:00:00Z",
      "servers": {}
    }
----
+
Notice the `servers` object is empty. We'll populate it later using automatic server discovery.

=== Managing Credentials Securely

Database credentials are stored as a Kubernetes secret. In Kubernetes, secrets are base64-encoded (not encrypted by default, though OpenShift encrypts them at rest in etcd). The key principle: never store credentials in ConfigMaps or commit them to Git in plain text.

[NOTE]
====
In production environments, integrate with dedicated secret management solutions:

* *HashiCorp Vault*: Dynamic secrets, automatic rotation, audit logging
* *External Secrets Operator*: Sync secrets from AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, GCP Secret Manager
* *Sealed Secrets*: Encrypt secrets for safe Git storage

For this lab, we use a simple secret for convenience, but the security reminder in the YAML comments is important.
====

[start=3]
. Create a secret with the User ID and Password for the PostgreSQL database.
Create a file `secret-mcp-registry-db-password.yaml` under `templates`:
+
[source,yaml,role=execute,subs=attributes]
----
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mcp-registry-db-password
  namespace: {{ .Values.namespace }}
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave: "1"
type: Opaque
stringData:
  user-password: app_password
  migrator-password: migrator_password
----

=== Creating the Registry Service

The `MCPRegistry` custom resource is the heart of the deployment. When you create this resource, the ToolHive operator:

. *Deploys the registry API service* — A REST API that implements the MCP Registry specification
. *Configures database connectivity* — Connects to PostgreSQL using the credentials you provided
. *Loads the server catalog* — Reads your ConfigMap and populates the registry database
. *Sets up synchronization* — Periodically re-reads the source to pick up changes

Key configuration options:

* `registries[].configMapRef`: Points to your server catalog ConfigMap
* `syncPolicy.interval`: How often to sync (enables updates without pod restarts)
* `databaseConfig`: Connection details including separate credentials for runtime and migrations

[start=4]
. Create the MCP Registry by adding file `mcpregistry.yaml` to the `templates` directory:
+
[source,yaml,role=execute,subs=attributes]
----
---
apiVersion: toolhive.stacklok.dev/v1alpha1
kind: MCPRegistry
metadata:
  name: mcp-registry
  namespace: {{ .Values.namespace }}
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave: "2"
spec:
  displayName: "{{ .Values.user }} MCP Registry"
  registries:
  - name: mcp-registry
    format: toolhive
    configMapRef:
      name: mcp-registry-config
      key: registry.json
    syncPolicy:
      interval: "1h"
  authConfig:
    mode: anonymous # Use "oauth" for production
  databaseConfig:
    host: mcp-registry-db-rw.{{ .Values.namespace }}.svc.cluster.local
    port: 5432
    database: registry
    sslMode: require
    user: db_app
    migrationUser: db_migrator
    dbAppUserPasswordSecretRef:
      name: mcp-registry-db-password
      key: user-password
    dbMigrationUserPasswordSecretRef:
      name: mcp-registry-db-password
      key: migrator-password
----

=== Exposing the Registry API

[start=5]
. In order to be able to test the registry add a `Route` so that we can access the registry from outside our cluster.
Add file `route-mcpregistry.yaml` to the `templates` directory:
+
[source,yaml,role=execute,subs=attributes]
----
---
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: mcp-registry
  namespace: {{ .Values.namespace }}
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave: "2"
spec:
  port:
    targetPort: http
  tls:
    termination: edge
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: mcp-registry-api
    weight: 100
  wildcardPolicy: None
----

The route makes the registry API accessible from outside the OpenShift cluster. This enables several use cases:

* *Developer laptops* can query available servers without cluster access
* *CI/CD pipelines* can discover server endpoints programmatically
* *External AI clients* can auto-configure based on registry contents (future capability)

[TIP]
====
For production deployments, consider these additional security measures:

* *Authentication*: Add an OAuth proxy or mTLS for client authentication
* *Network policies*: Restrict which source IPs can reach the registry
* *Rate limiting*: Prevent abuse of the API
====

=== Verifying the Empty Registry

Once all resources are deployed, you can query the registry API to verify it's working correctly.

[start=6]
. Once everything has synced to your namespace, query the registry to confirm it's empty:
+
[source,sh,role=execute,subs=attributes]
----
curl -s https://mcp-registry-mcp-gitea-{user}.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/registry/v0.1/servers | jq
----
+
You should see an empty servers array:
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "servers": [],
  "metadata": {
    "count": 0
  }
}
----

The registry is running but has no servers registered yet. Next, we'll use ToolHive's automatic server registration feature to populate it.

== Registering MCP Servers with the Registry

ToolHive supports automatic server registration through annotations on MCPServer resources. When an MCPServer has the `toolhive.stacklok.dev/registry-export: "true"` annotation, the registry controller automatically discovers and registers it.

The registration annotations are:

* `toolhive.stacklok.dev/registry-export: "true"` — Enable auto-registration for this server
* `toolhive.stacklok.dev/registry-description` — Human-readable description for the registry
* `toolhive.stacklok.dev/registry-url` — The registry URL to register with

=== Adding Registry Annotations to MCP Servers

Let's register two of our MCP servers with the registry. We'll intentionally leave the Yardstick server unregistered to demonstrate enforcement later.

[NOTE]
====
The OpenShift MCP server is deployed in a separate namespace (`mcp-openshift-{user}`) while the registry runs in `mcp-gitea-{user}`. The ToolHive registry controller only discovers MCPServers in its own namespace, so we cannot auto-register the OpenShift server with this registry. In production, you could either:

* Deploy a registry in each namespace that needs registration
* Use static ConfigMap entries to register cross-namespace servers
* Deploy all related MCP servers in the same namespace as the registry
====

[start=7]
. Remove the *Yardstick* MCP server definition from the Gitea repository by deleting the file `/mcp/helm/mcp-gitea/templates/mcpserver-yardstick.yaml` (select the file and then click the *Delete File* icon). Later we will try to add it back - and this will fail because it will no longer be an allowed MCP server.
. Update the Gitea MCP server definition (`/mcp/helm/mcp-gitea/templates/mcpserver.yaml`) with registry annotations:
+
[source,yaml,role=execute,subs=attributes]
----
apiVersion: toolhive.stacklok.dev/v1alpha1
kind: MCPServer
metadata:
  name: gitea
  namespace: {{ .Values.namespace }}
  annotations:
    toolhive.stacklok.dev/registry-export: "true"
    toolhive.stacklok.dev/registry-description: "Gitea MCP Server for Gitea repository operations"
    toolhive.stacklok.dev/registry-url: http://mcp-registry-api.mcp-gitea-{{ .Values.user }}.svc.cluster.local:8080
spec:
  # ... existing spec unchanged
----

. Update the Fetch MCP server definition (`/mcp/helm/mcp-gitea/templates/mcpserver-fetch.yaml`) with registry annotations:
+
[source,yaml,role=execute,subs=attributes]
----
apiVersion: toolhive.stacklok.dev/v1alpha1
kind: MCPServer
metadata:
  name: fetch
  namespace: {{ .Values.namespace }}
  annotations:
    toolhive.stacklok.dev/registry-export: "true"
    toolhive.stacklok.dev/registry-description: "Fetch MCP Server for web content retrieval"
    toolhive.stacklok.dev/registry-url: http://mcp-registry-api.mcp-gitea-{{ .Values.user }}.svc.cluster.local:8080
spec:
  # ... existing spec unchanged
----

[start=10]
. Commit and push your changes. Wait for ArgoCD to sync the updated MCPServer resources.

=== Verifying Registered Servers

[start=11]
. Query the registry to see the auto-registered servers:
+
[source,sh,role=execute,subs=attributes]
----
curl -s https://mcp-registry-mcp-gitea-{user}.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/registry/v0.1/servers | jq
----
+
You should now see two servers registered:
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "server": {
        "name": "com.toolhive.k8s.mcp-gitea-{user}/fetch",
        "description": "Fetch MCP Server for web content retrieval",
        ...
      }
    },
    {
      "server": {
        "name": "com.toolhive.k8s.mcp-gitea-{user}/gitea",
        "description": "Gitea MCP Server for Git repository operations",
        ...
      }
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "count": 2
  }
}
----

The registry has automatically discovered and registered the two MCP servers that have the export annotation. The Yardstick server is not registered because it lacks the annotation and the OpenShift MCP server is not registered because it runs in another namespace.

=== Understanding the Registry Output

The JSON response from the registry API provides comprehensive information about each registered server:

*Server Identity*:: The `name` field uniquely identifies the server. For dynamically-discovered servers, this includes the namespace to ensure uniqueness across the cluster.

*Description and Metadata*:: Human-readable descriptions help users understand what each server does. The `_meta` section contains base64-encoded extended metadata including tags, tier, and tool lists.

*Package Information*:: The `packages` array describes how to obtain and run the server — the container image, transport type, and version.

*Remote Endpoints*:: For running servers, the `remotes` array includes the actual endpoint URLs for connecting to the server.

*Server Count*:: The `metadata.count` field shows the total number of servers in the registry — useful for monitoring catalog growth and ensuring expected servers are present.

== Exploring MCP Registry Capabilities

Now that your registry is operational, let's explore what you can do with it. These exercises demonstrate the practical value of having a centralized server catalog.

=== Querying the Registry API

The registry API follows REST conventions. Here are some useful queries:

==== List All Server Names

Get a quick view of what's available:

[source,sh,role=execute,subs=attributes]
----
curl -s https://mcp-registry-mcp-gitea-{user}.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/registry/v0.1/servers | jq -r '.servers[].server.name'
----

.Example output
[source,subs=attributes]
----
com.toolhive.k8s.mcp-gitea-{user}/fetch
com.toolhive.k8s.mcp-gitea-{user}/gitea
----

This is useful for:

* *Self-service discovery*: Developers can see available AI tools without documentation hunting
* *Scripting*: Automation can iterate over available servers
* *Inventory checks*: Verify expected servers are registered

==== Get Full Server Details

Retrieve complete information about the Fetch MCP server:

[source,sh,role=execute,subs=attributes]
----
curl -s https://mcp-registry-mcp-gitea-{user}.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/registry/v0.1/servers | jq '.servers[] | select(.server.name | contains("fetch"))'
----

This provides all configuration details in one place — no hunting through multiple sources.

=== Governance Workflows

The registry enables structured governance of AI tool access. Here are patterns you can implement:

==== Adding a New Approved Server

When a team wants to introduce a new MCP server:

. *Review request*: Security/platform team evaluates the server
. *Add to catalog*: Edit the ConfigMap in Gitea to add the server entry
. *Wait for sync*: The registry picks up changes based on `syncPolicy.interval`
. *Verify registration*: Query the registry to confirm the new server appears
. *Announce availability*: Teams can now discover and use the server

This workflow ensures controlled introduction of new AI capabilities with an audit trail in Git.

==== Server Lifecycle Management

Use the `status` field to communicate server lifecycle:

* *Active*: Server is production-ready and recommended for use
* *Deprecated*: Server works but is being phased out — migrate to alternatives
* *Experimental*: Server is available for testing but not production-approved

Clients can filter on status to avoid deprecated servers. This enables safe transitions when retiring old capabilities.

==== Tier-Based Access Control

The `tier` field enables risk-based policies:

* *Official*: Vetted and supported by your organization
* *Community*: Third-party servers — use with awareness of support limitations
* *Experimental*: Cutting-edge but potentially unstable

Production environments might only permit "Official" tier servers, while development environments allow broader access.

==== Enforcing Approved Servers Only

The governance patterns above — tier classification, lifecycle status, and approval workflows — are informational by default. The registry documents which servers are approved, but nothing prevents someone from deploying an unapproved server.

ToolHive provides *registry enforcement* to close this gap. When enabled, the operator validates that any MCPServer deployed in the namespace uses an image that exists in the registry catalog. Unapproved servers are rejected before they can run.

This addresses several enterprise requirements:

*Compliance*:: Auditors can verify that only approved AI tools are deployed. The registry serves as the authoritative list of permitted capabilities.

*Shadow AI Prevention*:: Teams cannot deploy random MCP servers from the internet. All AI tool access must go through the approval process.

*Change Management*:: Adding new AI capabilities requires updating the registry — creating an auditable change record in Git.

== Creating the Approved Server Catalog

Now that we have servers registered dynamically, let's create a static approved server list. This creates a permanent record of approved servers that persists even if the running servers are stopped.

=== Updating the Registry ConfigMap

[start=12]
. In Gitea, update the ConfigMap (`configmap-mcp-registry-config.yaml`). Edit the file and replace the file contents with this new, updated definition:
+

. Commit and push the changes. The registry now has both:
+
* *Auto-discovered servers* — From MCPServer annotations
* *Static catalog entries* — From the ConfigMap

This dual-source approach provides flexibility: servers can be discovered automatically while administrators maintain a curated approved list.

== Enabling Registry Enforcement

With our approved server list in the registry, we can now enable enforcement. This will prevent any MCP server deployments that aren't registered.

[start=16]
. Update the MCPRegistry (`mcpregistry.yaml`) to enable enforcement by adding `enforceServers: true`:
+
[source,yaml,role=execute,subs=attributes]
----
---
apiVersion: toolhive.stacklok.dev/v1alpha1
kind: MCPRegistry
metadata:
  name: mcp-registry
  namespace: {{ .Values.namespace }}
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave: "2"
spec:
  enforceServers: true  # <-- Add this line
  [...]
----
+
The `enforceServers: true` field tells ToolHive to validate all MCPServer resources in this namespace against the registry catalog.

. Commit and push your changes. ArgoCD will sync the updated MCPRegistry.
. Once the MCP Registry has been updated you can check that it should now show 4 MCP servers registered:
[source,sh,role=execute,subs=attributes]
----
curl -s https://mcp-registry-mcp-gitea-{user}.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/registry/v0.1/servers | jq -r '.servers[].server.name'
----
+
.Sample output
[source,subs=attributes]
----
io.github.stacklok/fetch-mcp-server
io.github.stacklok/gitea-mcp-server
com.toolhive.k8s.mcp-gitea-{user}/fetch
com.toolhive.k8s.mcp-gitea-{user}/gitea
----

. Verify enforcement is active by checking the MCPRegistry status:
+
[source,sh,role=execute,subs=attributes]
----
oc get mcpregistry mcp-registry -n mcp-gitea-{user} -o jsonpath='{.status.enforcement}'
----
+
You should see `enabled` or similar status indicating enforcement is active.

== Demonstrating Enforcement

Now let's see enforcement in action. Earlier, we deleted the Yardstick MCP server. Let's try to re-deploy it now that enforcement is enabled.

=== Attempting to Deploy an Unapproved Server

[start=17]
. In Gitea, recreate the Yardstick MCP server definition. Add file `mcpserver-yardstick.yaml` back to the `/mcp/helm/mcp-gitea/templates/` directory with the following content:
+
[source,yaml,role=execute,subs=attributes]
----
apiVersion: toolhive.stacklok.dev/v1alpha1
kind: MCPServer
metadata:
  name: yardstick
  namespace: {{ .Values.namespace }}
spec:
  image: ghcr.io/stackloklabs/yardstick/yardstick-server:1.1.0
  transport: stdio
  proxyMode: streamable-http
----

. Commit and push your changes. Wait for ArgoCD to sync.

=== Observing the Blocked Server

[start=19]
. Check the status of all MCP servers:
+
[source,sh,role=execute,subs=attributes]
----
oc get mcpservers -n mcp-gitea-{user}
----

. The Yardstick server should show an error or blocked state. Check its events:
+
[source,sh,role=execute,subs=attributes]
----
oc describe mcpserver yardstick -n mcp-gitea-{user}
----
+
The events will show a message similar to:
+
----
Warning  EnforcementBlocked  image "ghcr.io/stackloklabs/yardstick/yardstick-server:1.1.0"
not found in any enforcing registry in namespace "mcp-gitea-{user}"
----

This demonstrates that:

* The two registered servers (Gitea, Fetch) continue to operate normally
* The unapproved server (Yardstick) is blocked by enforcement before it can run
* New server deployments must be added to the registry before they can run

[NOTE]
====
The enforcement validation happens at admission time — before the pod is created. This is more secure than runtime enforcement because unapproved code never executes.
====

=== Resolving the Blocked Server

To allow the Yardstick server, you would need to either:

. *Add registry annotations* to the Yardstick MCPServer resource (same as you did for Gitea and Fetch), OR
. *Manually add Yardstick* to the ConfigMap catalog with appropriate metadata

Both approaches create an audit trail in Git, ensuring all approved servers are documented and version-controlled.

This demonstrates the complete governance workflow:

* Servers must be added to the registry catalog (via ConfigMap in Git)
* The registry syncs and makes the server discoverable
* Enforcement validates deployments against the catalog
* Only approved images can run in the namespace

=== Integration Patterns

The registry API enables powerful automation scenarios:

==== CLI Tooling

Create scripts that query the registry before operations:

[source,sh,role=execute,subs=attributes]
----
#!/bin/bash
# Example: List available MCP servers with their descriptions
REGISTRY_URL="https://mcp-registry-mcp-gitea-{user}.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}"

curl -s "${REGISTRY_URL}/registry/v0.1/servers" | \
  jq -r '.servers[] | "\(.server.name): \(.server.description)"'
----

This reduces manual configuration and ensures consistency.

==== Monitoring Integration

Track registry health with simple checks:

[source,sh,role=execute,subs=attributes]
----
# Check that expected number of servers are registered
SERVER_COUNT=$(curl -s https://mcp-registry-mcp-gitea-{user}.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/registry/v0.1/servers | jq '.metadata.count')
echo "Registered servers: ${SERVER_COUNT}"

# Alert if below expected threshold
if [ "$SERVER_COUNT" -lt 2 ]; then
  echo "WARNING: Expected at least 2 servers, found ${SERVER_COUNT}"
fi
----

This can integrate with Prometheus AlertManager or other monitoring systems.

=== Ideas for Further Exploration

Try these additional exercises to deepen your understanding:

. *Add a custom server entry*: Edit the ConfigMap to add a fictional MCP server with your own metadata. Watch it appear in the registry after sync.
. *Experiment with tags*: Add tags like "team-platform" or "env-production" to organize servers. Query to filter by tag.
. *Test sync behavior*: Modify an existing entry in the ConfigMap (change the description). Observe how quickly the registry reflects the change.
. *Explore the API*: The registry follows the https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/blob/main/docs/reference/api/generic-registry-api.md[MCP Registry specification^]. Review the spec to discover additional endpoints and capabilities.
. *Consider federation*: In a multi-cluster environment, how would you aggregate registries? Each cluster could have its own registry, with a federated view for discovery across environments.
. *Plan for scale*: As your organization adds more MCP servers, what governance processes would you implement? Consider approval workflows, periodic reviews, and automated compliance checks.

== Summary

In this module, you deployed an MCP Registry and experienced the complete governance workflow:

* *Empty start*: Deployed a registry with no pre-defined servers
* *Automatic registration*: Used annotations to register running servers with the registry
* *Dynamic discovery*: Watched the registry populate automatically with two servers (Gitea and Fetch)
* *Catalog extraction*: Captured discovered servers as an approved list
* *Enforcement activation*: Enabled server validation against the registry
* *Blocked unapproved server*: Saw enforcement prevent the unregistered Yardstick server from running

You also learned that the ToolHive registry controller only discovers MCPServers within its own namespace, which is an important architectural consideration when planning your MCP deployment topology.

This foundation enables your organization to scale AI tool adoption while maintaining control, visibility, and compliance. The enforcement capability ensures that governance isn't just documentation — it's actively enforced at deployment time.
